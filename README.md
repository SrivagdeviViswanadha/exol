# ‚öΩ PPO Training in Google Research Football (GFootball)

This repository contains two reinforcement learning training scripts using **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** from Stable-Baselines3 to train agents in the [Google Research Football Environment](https://github.com/google-research/football).

Both scripts include periodic evaluation, checkpoint saving, and training loss logging.
